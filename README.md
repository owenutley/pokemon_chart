Welcome to my pokemon chart comparison builder.

In order to run this file you will need to install the requirements in the requirements.txt file.

You may also want to create a virtual environment before installing these requirements.



Creates environment: python -m venv venv

Activates environment: source venv/bin/activate

Installs requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run project: python3 poke_chart.py



This Program uses the pokeapi at pokeapi.com

It uses the api to pull stats and a few other information pieces to put together a chart for comparisons.



The data.json file is used for temperary storage for data pulled from the api. The information in the file currently if changed will not result in breaking the Program at runtime.
